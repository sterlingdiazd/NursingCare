4. User Stories and Tasks (Fully Detailed)
US-1.1: Create the Backend Solution Skeleton

Story: As a system owner, I want a properly structured ASP.NET Core 10 solution so that the system can grow without becoming unmaintainable.

Why this exists: If the solution starts as a monolith with everything in one project, technical debt becomes irreversible. This story exists to prevent that outcome.

Tasks:

Create a new ASP.NET Core 10 solution with separate projects for Api, Application, Domain, and Infrastructure.

This enforces architectural boundaries from day one.
Project references must be strictly one-directional: Api → Application → Domain, and Infrastructure → Application/Domain.
Configure dependency injection and composition root in Api.

This ensures Infrastructure is pluggable and testable.
Add global exception handling middleware.

This ensures the API never leaks stack traces and always returns controlled error responses.
Add health check endpoint.

This is required for Azure monitoring and uptime validation.
Acceptance Criteria:

Solution builds
API runs
Health endpoint responds










Backend Tasks
Create solution structure
Configure EF Core + SQL Server
Create Users, Roles tables
Implement JWT auth
Implement policies
Implement endpoints
Add logging
Each task must include:

Tests
Migration


I prefer do the validations using model binding validations



Phase Plan (High Level)

We will do this in phases:

Phase 1 — Persistence (SQL Server)

Replace InMemory with SQL Server

Add EF Core migrations

Create real tables

Verify data is actually persisted

Phase 2 — Quality Gates

Add:

Domain unit tests

Application handler tests

API integration test

Add:

dotnet test to pipeline

Phase 3 — Production Hardening

Proper:

Configuration

Logging

Validation

Error handling

Health checks

Phase 4 — CI/CD

GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps:

Build

Test

Publish

Deploy

Phase 5 — Cloud

Azure:

App Service

Azure SQL

Secrets

Environments

Phase 6 — Frontends

React (Web)

React Native (Mobile)

Call the same endpoint
