4. User Stories and Tasks (Fully Detailed)
US-1.1: Create the Backend Solution Skeleton

Story: As a system owner, I want a properly structured ASP.NET Core 10 solution so that the system can grow without becoming unmaintainable.

Why this exists: If the solution starts as a monolith with everything in one project, technical debt becomes irreversible. This story exists to prevent that outcome.

Tasks:

Create a new ASP.NET Core 10 solution with separate projects for Api, Application, Domain, and Infrastructure.

This enforces architectural boundaries from day one.
Project references must be strictly one-directional: Api → Application → Domain, and Infrastructure → Application/Domain.
Configure dependency injection and composition root in Api.

This ensures Infrastructure is pluggable and testable.
Add global exception handling middleware.

This ensures the API never leaks stack traces and always returns controlled error responses.
Add health check endpoint.

This is required for Azure monitoring and uptime validation.
Acceptance Criteria:

Solution builds
API runs
Health endpoint responds










Backend Tasks
Create solution structure
Configure EF Core + SQL Server
Create Users, Roles tables
Implement JWT auth
Implement policies
Implement endpoints
Add logging
Each task must include:

Tests
Migration


I prefer do the validations using model binding validations
